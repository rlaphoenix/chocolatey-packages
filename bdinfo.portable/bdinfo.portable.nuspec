    <summary>Bluray video and audio technical specs information recorder.</summary>
    <description>
      This specific version is by UniqProject (Juergen Tem), the original is by late cinemasquid.com.
      The BDInfo tool was designed to collect video and audio technical specifications from Blu-ray movie discs, including:

      - Disc Size
      - Playlist File Contents
      - Stream Codec and Bitrate Details

      ## Requirements

      - Windows 7 or higher Operating System
      - Blu-ray BD-ROM Drive
      - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or Higher
      - Source Code

      The BDInfo source code is licensed under the LGPL 2.1.
      The free tool Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express can be used to build the source code.

      ## Known Issues

      Occasionally inaccurate bit-depth measurement on Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master audio streams.
      BDInfo will NOT function correctly with copy-protected discs. You will have to decrypt commercial Blu-ray movie
      discs before you will be able to gather any info.
